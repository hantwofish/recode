%If the document is very long, it may be very useful for a lot of readers to have an index for searching key words and certain concepts (Crtl+F is usually very helpful in PDFs but not always the best solution). For this, the  package \imp{makeidx}, the commands \imp{makeindex} and \imp{printindex} and the compiling option \imp{makeindex} are needed. You may want to index different words like heterogeneous materials\index{Heterogeneous materials}, effective properties\index{Effective properties} and homogenization\index{Homogenization}.
